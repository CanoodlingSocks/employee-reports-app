## Repo with combined frontend (React/TS) and backend (C# .Net 7)

__How to run both the backend and frontend using Git Bash:__ <br>
* Open root folder
* Right-click 'Git Bash here'
* in terminal, write 'bash quickstart.sh'
* __To close connections, press 'CTRL' + 'C'!

Alternatively, you could run both the backend and frontend via the terminal in VS Code, but this method is a bit cumbersome. <br>
__How to run in VS Code Terminal:__ <br>
* cd to root folder
* cd Backend
* dotnet run
* open new terminal
* cd back to root folder
* cd client && npm start
* __To close connections, press 'CTRL' + 'C' and confirm 'Y' in both terminals!__

__You can view the Frontend on http://localhost:3000__ <br>
__and the Backend will be running on http://localhost:5255/swagger__
